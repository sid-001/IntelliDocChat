## Features

- **Knowledge Base Selection:** Choose a knowledge base from the left panel, allowing you to focus on specific document collections.

- **Document Upload:** Upload a PDF file containing your document data, enabling the system to process and analyze the content.

- **Conversational Interface:** Engage in natural language conversations with your documents using the chat interface. Ask questions, request information, and explore your documents dynamically.

- **Insights and Answers:** Gain insights and answers from your documents through the chat interface. IntelliDocChat employs advanced language understanding to provide relevant and accurate responses.

- **Embedding Options:** IntelliDocChat is built using BGE BASE-EN Embeddings by default, but it also supports other embeddings through Sentence Transformers, giving you the flexibility to experiment with different language representations.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Knowledge Base:** On the left panel of the application interface, select a knowledge base that corresponds to the collection of documents you want to interact with.

2. **Upload a PDF Document:** Use the document upload feature to provide the system with the PDF document you want to explore. This document will be processed and made available for chat interactions.

3. **Start Chatting:** Engage in a natural language conversation with your uploaded document. Type your questions, prompts, or requests in the chat interface, and IntelliDocChat will provide responses based on the content of the document.

4. **Explore and Gain Insights:** Through the chat interface, you can dynamically explore the content of your document. Ask for specific information, summaries, or any other insights you're seeking.

5. **Switch Knowledge Bases (Optional):** If you have multiple document collections, you can switch between different knowledge bases to interact with various documents.

## Supported Embeddings

IntelliDocChat is initially configured to use BGE BASE-EN Embeddings, which are integrated with Sentence Transformers. However, you have the option to experiment with other embeddings by integrating them with Sentence Transformers.

### How to install IntelliDocChat Locally?
Directly using IntelliDocChat on Windows is not recommended; however, it will run smoothly when using WSL2 on Windows. Here are the installation steps for IntelliDocChat, assuming you are using a Linux/Debian system. These steps will help you set up IntelliDocChat, making sure to use Python version 3.10 or lower, as Numpy does not support Python 3.11:

1. Clone the IntelliDocChat repository from GitHub:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sid-001/IntelliDocChat.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository directory:
    ```
    cd IntelliDocChat
    ```

3. Create the required directories:
    ```
    mkdir tmp knowledge_base
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
    ```
   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. Set up a virtual environment named 'env':
    ```
    virtualenv env
    ```

6. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

7. Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

8. Run the IntelliDocChat using Streamlit:
    ```
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key in step 5. This set of instructions should help you install IntelliDocChat on your Linux/Debian system using Python version 3.10 or lower.
