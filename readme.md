## Features

- **Knowledge Base Selection:** Choose a knowledge base from the left panel, allowing you to focus on specific document collections.

- **Document Upload:** Upload a PDF file containing your document data, enabling the system to process and analyze the content.

- **Conversational Interface:** Engage in natural language conversations with your documents using the chat interface. Ask questions, request information, and explore your documents dynamically.

- **Insights and Answers:** Gain insights and answers from your documents through the chat interface. IntelliDocChat employs advanced language understanding to provide relevant and accurate responses.

- **Embedding Options:** IntelliDocChat is built using BGE BASE-EN Embeddings by default, but it also supports other embeddings through Sentence Transformers, giving you the flexibility to experiment with different language representations.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Knowledge Base:** On the left panel of the application interface, select a knowledge base that corresponds to the collection of documents you want to interact with.

2. **Upload a PDF Document:** Use the document upload feature to provide the system with the PDF document you want to explore. This document will be processed and made available for chat interactions.

3. **Start Chatting:** Engage in a natural language conversation with your uploaded document. Type your questions, prompts, or requests in the chat interface, and IntelliDocChat will provide responses based on the content of the document.

4. **Explore and Gain Insights:** Through the chat interface, you can dynamically explore the content of your document. Ask for specific information, summaries, or any other insights you're seeking.

5. **Switch Knowledge Bases (Optional):** If you have multiple document collections, you can switch between different knowledge bases to interact with various documents.

## Supported Embeddings

IntelliDocChat is initially configured to use BGE BASE-EN Embeddings, which are integrated with Sentence Transformers. However, you have the option to experiment with other embeddings by integrating them with Sentence Transformers.
